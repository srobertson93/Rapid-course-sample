00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.607
It's been estimated that the average adult

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.577
makes more than 35,000 decisions per day.

3
00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.247
Some of those decisions
are straightforward and simple.

4
00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:19.352
Some of them, however, are not so clear.

5
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.223
At Twilio, we strive to consistently

6
00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:26.259
improve our processes to ensure sharper,

7
00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:30.063
more structured decision
making to support this goal.

8
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.100
We are adopting RAPID,
which is a well-regarded decision

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.569
making framework as the Twilio standard.

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.373
The RAPID model is broadly used by teams

11
00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.643
to bring transparency around
how decisions are made,

12
00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.547
improve organizational buy-in
through the involvement of critical

13
00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.951
stakeholders, and provide
a shared set of standards for all to use

14
00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:55.422
regardless of function
or level of seniority.

15
00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.758
That last point is an important
one to remember.

16
00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.162
It doesn't matter what your role
or function might be.

17
00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.900
You can play a critical role
or even lead a RAPID process.

18
00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:12.472
Everyone at Twilio is encouraged and
should feel empowered to leverage RAPID.

19
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.275
By the end of this training,

20
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:19.312
you will be well versed in the common
language around RAPID and feel

21
00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:23.550
comfortable building a solid decision
making team using the tool.

22
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:29.089
Soon enough, you will be ready to
utilize it within your projects and teams.
