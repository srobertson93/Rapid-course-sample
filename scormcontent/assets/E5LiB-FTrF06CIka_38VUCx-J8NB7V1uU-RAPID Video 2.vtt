1
00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.707
So what is RAPID?

2
00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.710
To start the letters in RAPID

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.547
stand for the key roles involved.

4
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.051
You'll often hear
these roles referred to as letters

5
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.121
rather than their full name.

6
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.190
The R: Recommend.

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.226
Running a successful RAPID

8
00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.862
largely depends on Recommend's management.

9
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:34.234
This role is in charge of running the show
by making sure the right people

10
00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:38.371
are in the right roles, running
the tactical pieces of the process,

11
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.075
and ultimately building a business case
and presenting

12
00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.279
the final recommendation.

13
00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.281
The A: Agree.

14
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.418
In order for the 'R'
to present their recommendation

15
00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.388
to the person making the decision,
they must partner with the 'A.'

16
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.391
The 'A's role here is to

17
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.327
make sure
they provide their critical expertise

18
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.198
and work together with the 'R' on
any revisions needed

19
00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:10.036
if the recommendation doesn't pass
their standards.

20
00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.372
The P: Perform.

21
00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:17.177
The 'P' helps ensure that any rapid decision
actually comes to fruition.

22
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.680
Once the decision has been made.

23
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.250
The 'P' is responsible
for leading the implementation

24
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.219
as soon as possible.

25
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.756
As such, most of this role's
responsibilities

26
00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.359
will happen after the decision.

27
00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.029
The I: Input.

28
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.699
The 'I' is the foundation
for building a solid recommendation.

29
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.036
Think of these as your subject matter
experts.

30
00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.173
This role plays an early and critical part

31
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.477
in providing the R with high quality
information

32
00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:53.913
and expertise.

33
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.917
As a best practice, this role will include
perspectives from people, teams,

34
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:02.655
or functions who have direct knowledge
and expertise of the matter at hand.

35
00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.993
Finally, because Twilio is fully committed

36
00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:11.297
to becoming an anti-racist company,
input should contain

37
00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.368
inclusive perspectives
informed by our anti-racism framework.

38
00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.705
DEI will often serve

39
00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:23.042
as an 'I,' providing
input to consider relative to the business

40
00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:27.080
decision, though
may be elevated to A where appropriate.

41
00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.451
The D: Decide.

42
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.020
When you hear someone ask "who has the 'D?'"

43
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.223
this is the role they're talking about.

44
00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.660
This person is responsible
for committing the organization

45
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.596
to action based on 'R's recommendation,

46
00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:49.169
holding the 'P' accountable for execution,
and ultimately communicating

47
00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:54.741
the outcomes and lessons
learned regardless of success.
